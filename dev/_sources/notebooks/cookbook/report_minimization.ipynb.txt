Note that `MinimizationReporter` was introduced in OpenMM 8.1.\n",

    "The syntax for doing this is somewhat different to typical OpenMM functionality. You will need to define a subclass of `MinimizationReporter` that has a `report()` method. Within this report method you can write code to take any action you want. The report method is called every iteration of the minimizer. Read the [API documentation](http://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.openmm.MinimizationReporter.html) for more explanation.\n",

    "You will notice that the energy does not change continuously and does not always decrease. This is because the L-BFGS algorithm used by the minimizer does not support constraints. The minimizer therefore replaces all constraints with harmonic restraints, then performs unconstrained minimization of a combined objective function that is the sum of the system’s potential energy and the restraint energy. Once minimization completes, it checks whether all constraints are satisfied to an acceptable tolerance. It not, it increases the strength of the harmonic restraints and performs additional minimization. If the error in constrained distances is especially large, it may choose to throw out all work that has been done so far and start over with stronger restraints. This has several important consequences:\n",
