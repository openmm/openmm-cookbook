The OpenMM Cookbook
===================

:doc:`Click here for the OpenMM Cookbook <cookbook>`

The OpenMM Cookbook contains short code examples for common tasks you can perform in OpenMM. 
The examples can be run directly in Colab; the runtime is a few seconds for each one.

The OpenMM Tutorials
====================

:doc:`Click here for the OpenMM Tutorials <tutorials>`

The OpenMM Tutorials are longer examples that walk you through specific simulation methods.
These can also be run in Colab, but due to the longer compute time required (tens of minutes to hours) you may find it better to run them on your own machine.
