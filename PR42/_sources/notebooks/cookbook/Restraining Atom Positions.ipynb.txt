    "## Restraining Atom Positions\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you want to run a simulation in which certain particles have their motion restricted, unable to move too far from where they started.  This is called *restraining* particles (not to be confused with *contraining* particles, in which they are kept completely fixed, and which is described in another entry).\n",
    "\n",
    "Position restraints are typically implemented by adding a harmonic force that binds each particle to its initial position.  The further it moves, the stronger the force pushing it back.  This is generally done by adding a CustomExternalForce to the System.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's copy the beginning of the `simulatePdb.py` script from the examples directory.  It loads a PDB file consisting of villin in water and builds a System from it."

We specify that x0, y0, and z0 are per-particle parameters, so each particle can have a different reference position.  Also note that we compute the distance with the `periodicdistance()` function.  This takes periodic boundary conditions into account.  If we were instead simulating a non-periodic system, we would specify the energy expression as `'k*((x-x0)^2+(y-y0)^2+(z-z0)^2)'`.\n",

    "Sometimes it is useful to change the target position of the restraint part way through a simulation.  This can happen, for example, in steered molecular dynamics where you want to make a particle follow a defined trajectory with time.  To do this, simply update the values of the per-particle parameters then call `updateParametersInContext()` to copy the new values over to the existing Context.  The following moves the target position of the first restrained particle by 0.1 nm in the x direction."
