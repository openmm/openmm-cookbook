    "# Simulating Conductive Electrodes with the Constant Potential Method\n",
    "\n",
    "The constant potential molecular dynamics method is an approach for simulating conductive materials with delocalized charges, and maintaining them at prescribed electric potentials.  In constant potential simulations, the charges on a prescribed set of particles (those belonging to the conductive material, or the \"electrode particles\") are allowed to fluctuate as they interact with other particles in the system.  This is useful for studying various kinds of electrochemical systems, *e.g.*, the electrode-electrolyte interface in a parallel plate capacitor.  In this tutorial, we will show how to set up a constant potential simulation using OpenMM's implementation of this method.  Specifically, we will use a capacitor system described in [Ref. 1](#References), with an aqueous NaCl electrolyte sandwiched between two Au electrodes:\n",

    "## Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "A full exposition of the theory behind constant potential simulations is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but it is useful to be acquainted with the basics before getting started.  In ordinary molecular simulations with fixed charges, we wish to sample configurations $\\mathbf{r}^N$ of $N$ particles based on some potential energy function $U(\\mathbf{r}^N)$.  In the constant potential approach, some number $M$ of particles are allowed to have varying charges, so that we have $U(\\mathbf{r}^N,\\mathbf{q}^M)$.  The commonly used method implemented by OpenMM for constant potential simulations uses a Born-Oppenheimer-like approach in which $\\mathbf{q}^M$ is chosen at every step to minimize $U$ for the given $\\mathbf{r}^N$.  Since electrostatic interactions can be treated with Coulomb's law, $U$ is quadratic in the $\\mathbf{q}^M$, and minimizing it is equivalent to solving a linear system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually computing the coefficients of this system, which are functions of the particle positions, is more complex.  For parallel plate capacitor geometries like the one shown above, the system effectively has periodic boundary conditions in the plane of the electrodes, but is non-periodic in the direction normal to their surfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"constant_potential_2.png\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few options for using periodic boundary conditions in all three dimensions so that standard tools for computing the electrostatic interactions, such as the particle mesh Ewald method, can be employed.  Leaving empty space  between periodic images introduces various complications, since this effectively creates a pair of dissimilar capacitors, one containing an electrolyte material of interest, and another containing vacuum.  Another option is a double cell geometry, with each periodic image containing the capacitor system of interest and a reflected copy of it.  This keeps the net potential difference across the simulation cell, and its net dipole moment, zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"constant_potential_3.png\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation in OpenMM supports such geometries, but they are more computationally expensive, requiring double the number of particles in the system of interest.  In this tutorial, we show how to use the finite field method described in [Ref. 2](#References), in which only a single copy of the system is needed, and an external electric field is applied to all charges in the system to maintain the desired electric potential difference across the periodic box:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"constant_potential_4.png\" width=\"800\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more details that this tutorial will not explore, but the reader is referred to [Refs. 1-3](#References) for more information about the theory, as well as to the [user guide](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/theory/02_standard_forces.html#constantpotentialforce) for the details of the specific implementation in OpenMM."

Besides the indices of the electrode atoms, this method takes the potential at which to hold the electrode, a Gaussian width parameter that is the reciprocal of the commonly used $\\eta$ value, and a Thomas-Fermi parameter with units of reciprocal width that should be set to the square of the Thomas-Fermi length divided by the atomic volume.  (To simulate a perfect conductor and eschew the Thomas-Fermi model entirely, set this parameter to zero.)  In this example, for the potential difference $\\Delta\\psi$ we want to apply, we set the potential of one electrode to $-\\Delta\\psi/2$ and that of the other to $\\Delta\\psi/2$."

    "## Notes and Troubleshooting\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we have seen how to set up a constant potential simulation in OpenMM.  The basic procedure, and considerations discussed above, should apply in general to any kind of system you want to simulate with the constant potential method.  However, there are a few issues that did not arise in the example we replicated that you should nevertheless be aware of.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, in this example, all electrode atoms were held fixed.  You may want to run a simulation with non-rigid electrodes.  This can be done by giving the electrode atoms non-zero masses (and ensuring that the interactions you have specified between them will stabilize the desired structure).  You may want to fix an atom or layer of atoms in each electrode in place in this case, or add a [CMMotionRemover](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.openmm.CMMotionRemover.html), to prevent them from drifting through the periodic box.  Here, we used the same fixed density for the electrolyte as [Ref. 1](#References), but you may want to use a barostat to equlibrate your constant potential simulation at constant pressure and determine the optimal spacing between the electrodes to avoid placing the electrolyte under excess pressure or under tension.  To do so, ensure first that you are using an anisotropic barostat like the [MonteCarloAnisotropicBarostat](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.openmm.MonteCarloAnisotropicBarostat.html).  For finite field simulations, you will need to update the electric field strength whenever the box size changes.  This can be done by calling [ConstantPotentialForce.setExternalField()](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.openmm.ConstantPotentialForce.html#openmm.openmm.ConstantPotentialForce.setExternalField) at the same interval as the update interval for the barostat, dividing the desired potential difference by the current width of the box, then calling [ConstantPotentialForce.updateParametersInContext()](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.openmm.ConstantPotentialForce.html#openmm.openmm.ConstantPotentialForce.updateParametersInContext) if the external field changed to apply this change to the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, if you are using the conjugate gradient solver, you may wish or need to adjust its convergence tolerance.  This can be done with [ConstantPotentialForce.setCGErrorTolerance()](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.openmm.ConstantPotentialForce.html#openmm.openmm.ConstantPotentialForce.setCGErrorTolerance).  The default is $10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{kJ/mol/e}$, or approximately $1.04\\ \\mathrm{\\mu V}$.  For typical applied potentials on the order of $1\\ \\mathrm{V}$, this accuracy should usually be sufficient.  If the solver is unable to converge to the requested tolerance, OpenMM will raise an exception.  This is usually caused by one of the following problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is a close overlap between an electrode atom and another atom, and either the initial positions that were set are unreasonable or the simulation has become unstable.\n",
    "* The Hessian of the potential energy with respect to the electrode charges is not positive definite.  This can occur if the Gaussian width parameters for the electrodes are too large; ensure that they are set to an appropriate value.\n",
    "* The tolerance is set too small and numerical issues are preventing convergence.  Either increase the tolerance, or if you need the accuracy, switch from single precision to mixed or double precision if the OpenMM platform provides this option.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some more information about the CG solver including its built-in preconditioner, and information about using ConstantPotentialForce with polarizable force fields, consult the [theory section](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/theory/02_standard_forces.html#constantpotentialforce) of the user guide."
