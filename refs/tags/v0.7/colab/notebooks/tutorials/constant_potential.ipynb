In constant potential simulations, the charges on a prescribed set of particles (those belonging to the conductive material, or the \"electrode particles\") are allowed to fluctuate as they interact with other particles in the system.  This is useful for studying various kinds of electrochemical systems, *e.g.*, the electrode-electrolyte interface in a parallel plate capacitor.  In this tutorial, we will show how to set up a constant potential simulation using OpenMM's implementation of this method.

In ordinary molecular simulations with fixed charges, we wish to sample configurations $\\mathbf{r}^N$ of $N$ particles based on some potential energy function $U(\\mathbf{r}^N)$.  In the constant potential approach, some number $M$ of particles are allowed to have varying charges, so that we have $U(\\mathbf{r}^N,\\mathbf{q}^M)$.  The commonly used method implemented by OpenMM for constant potential simulations uses a Born-Oppenheimer-like approach in which $\\mathbf{q}^M$ is chosen at every step to minimize $U$ for the given $\\mathbf{r}^N$.  Since electrostatic interactions can be treated with Coulomb's law, $U$ is quadratic in the $\\mathbf{q}^M$, and minimizing it is equivalent to solving a linear system.\n", "\n", "Actually computing the coefficients of this system, which are functions of the particle positions, is more complex.

The basic procedure, and considerations discussed above, should apply in general to any kind of system you want to simulate with the constant potential method.  However, there are a few issues that did not arise in the example we replicated that you should nevertheless be aware of.\n", "\n", "First, in this example, all electrode atoms were held fixed.  You may want to run a simulation with non-rigid electrodes.  This can be done by giving the electrode atoms non-zero masses (and ensuring that the interactions you have specified between them will stabilize the desired structure).  You may want to fix an atom or layer of atoms in each electrode in place in this case, or add a [CMMotionRemover](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.openmm.CMMotionRemover.html), to prevent them from drifting through the periodic box.  Here, we used the same fixed density for the electrolyte as [Ref. 1](#References), but you may want to use a barostat to equlibrate your constant potential simulation at constant pressure and determine the optimal spacing between the electrodes to avoid placing the electrolyte under excess pressure or under tension.  To do so, ensure first that you are using an anisotropic barostat like the [MonteCarloAnisotropicBarostat](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.openmm.MonteCarloAnisotropicBarostat.html).  For finite field simulations, you will need to update the electric field strength whenever the box size changes.  This can be done by calling [ConstantPotentialForce.setExternalField()](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.openmm.ConstantPotentialForce.html#openmm.openmm.ConstantPotentialForce.setExternalField) at the same interval as the update interval for the barostat, dividing the desired potential difference by the current width of the box, then calling [ConstantPotentialForce.updateParametersInContext()](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.openmm.ConstantPotentialForce.html#openmm.openmm.ConstantPotentialForce.updateParametersInContext) if the external field changed to apply this change to the simulation.\n", "\n", "Second, if you are using the conjugate gradient solver, you may wish or need to adjust its convergence tolerance.  This can be done with [ConstantPotentialForce.setCGErrorTolerance()](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.openmm.ConstantPotentialForce.html#openmm.openmm.ConstantPotentialForce.setCGErrorTolerance).  The default is $10^{-4}\\ \\mathrm{kJ/mol/e}$, or approximately $1.04\\ \\mathrm{\\mu V}$.  For typical applied potentials on the order of $1\\ \\mathrm{V}$, this accuracy should usually be sufficient.  If the solver is unable to converge to the requested tolerance, OpenMM will raise an exception.  This is usually caused by one of the following problems:\n", "\n", "* There is a close overlap between an electrode atom and another atom, and either the initial positions that were set are unreasonable or the simulation has become unstable.\n", "* The Hessian of the potential energy with respect to the electrode charges is not positive definite.  This can occur if the Gaussian width parameters for the electrodes are too large; ensure that they are set to an appropriate value.\n", "* The tolerance is set too small and numerical issues are preventing convergence.  Either increase the tolerance, or if you need the accuracy, switch from single precision to mixed or double precision if the OpenMM platform provides this option.\n", "\n", "For some more information about the CG solver including its built-in preconditioner, and information about using ConstantPotentialForce with polarizable force fields, consult the [theory section](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/theory/02_standard_forces.html#constantpotentialforce) of the user guide."]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "id": "6cb2fd7c-5d6f-4280-ae4b-597b5079057c", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## References\n", "\n", "1.
