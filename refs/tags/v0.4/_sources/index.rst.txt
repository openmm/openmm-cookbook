The OpenMM Cookbook & Tutorials
===============================

The OpenMM Cookbook & Tutorials is a collection of examples designed to provide
an introduction to OpenMM for new users, illustrate how to configure various
kinds of molecular simulations using the tools that OpenMM provides, and explain
how to perform various common simulation-related tasks in OpenMM.

* :doc:`The OpenMM Cookbook <cookbook>` contains short code examples for common
  tasks you can perform in OpenMM.
* :doc:`The OpenMM Tutorials <tutorials>` are longer examples that walk you
  through specific simulation methods.
* In addition to these categories, you can also :ref:`browse a list of examples
  by tag <genindex>`.

Each of the tutorials and cookbook entries contains a link to a Jupyter notebook
that allows you to download and run the code examples locally (if you have
OpenMM and Jupyter installed), and experiment by making your own changes and
seeing the results.  Alternatively, links are provided to run the notebooks
online within Google Colab.  The cookbook examples can be run directly in Colab;
the runtime is a few seconds for each one.  The tutorials can also be run in
Colab, but due to the longer compute time required (tens of minutes to hours)
you may find it better to run them on your own machine.
