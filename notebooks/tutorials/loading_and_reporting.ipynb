    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial in this series, we listed three primary methods for setting up and running simulations with OpenMM.  We have already seen how to use OpenMM Setup to prepare a simulation from a Protein Data Bank structure and generate a Python script to run OpenMM.  Here, we will consider the second method, and show how to use OpenMM to load input files prepared outside of OpenMM.  We will also explore the various options offered by OpenMM for reporting simulation results.  This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the material in the previous tutorial and already have OpenMM and OpenMM Setup installed.  If not, refer to [Getting Started with OpenMM](getting_started.ipynb) before returning here.\n",

    "In this tutorial, we will use input files generated by the LEaP utility in AmberTools.  Using LEaP or other features of AmberTools is out of the scope of the tutorial, and completing it does not require prior knowledge of these tools.  However, you may consult the Amber [tutorials](https://ambermd.org/tutorials/) or [reference manuals](https://ambermd.org/tutorials/) if you are looking for more information.  As we will discuss, OpenMM provides nearly identical mechanisms for loading CHARMM and Gromacs files, so you can easily adapt the instructions given here to these cases."

    "## Preparing Input Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Two kinds of Amber input files are needed to specify the initial state of a simulation: *prmtop* files specifying the atoms in a system and the interactions between them, and *inpcrd* files providing a set of initial coordinates.  Compared with a PDB or PDBx/mmCIF file specifying atoms and their connectivity, a prmtop file contains all of the interaction parameters for bonds, angles, *etc.* in a system.  As such, no separate force field files are needed when setting up a simulation from a prmtop.  Instead, you use a tool like LEaP to generate a prmtop from a description of a topology along with Amber force field data files.  For this tutorial, as an example, we have used LEaP to create prmtop and inpcrd files for alanine dipeptide in water by running the following LEaP input script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "source leaprc.protein.ff19SB\n",
    "source leaprc.water.opc\n",
    "chain = sequence { ACE ALA NME }\n",
    "solvateoct chain OPCBOX 10\n",
    "saveamberparm chain input.prmtop input.inpcrd\n",
    "quit\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a single alanine dipeptide molecule, solvates it, and parameterizes it with the Amber ff19SB force field and the OPC water model.  The output files, `input.prmtop` and `input.inpcrd`, are already provided with this tutorial, so it is not necessary to run LEaP yourself if you want to follow along.  However, if you want to experiment with modifications to the input files, you could [install AmberTools](https://ambermd.org/GetAmber.php#ambertools) and regenerate the files yourself with a command like\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "tleap -f input.dat\n",
    "```\n",
    "after saving the above LEaP commands to a file `input.dat`, for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will again use OpenMM Setup to generate a starting input file.  Since the previous tutorial covers [installing and running OpenMM Setup](getting_started.ipynb#Installing-OpenMM-and-Running-OpenMM-Setup) in detail, we will not discuss it at length again.  To work with Amber files in OpenMM Setup, simply choose the \"Amber\" option from the start page instead of the \"PDB\" option.  Select your prmtop and inpcrd files when prompted.  Since LEaP has already done all of the work of assigning force field parameters, there are no further preparation steps required before OpenMM Setup generates an input script.  For this example, we can keep the default options, except that we will equilibrate for 10,000 steps and run for only 100,000 steps.  This will generate a script that looks like:"

    "There are two things to keep in mind when retrieving a State from an OpenMM Context.  First, except for [State.getPeriodicBoxVectors()](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.openmm.State.html#openmm.openmm.State.getPeriodicBoxVectors), [State.getPeriodicBoxVolume()](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.openmm.State.html#openmm.openmm.State.getPeriodicBoxVolume), [State.getStepCount()](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.openmm.State.html#openmm.openmm.State.getStepCount), and [State.getTime()](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.openmm.State.html#openmm.openmm.State.getTime), you must explicitly request that data be retrieved in [Context.getState()](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.openmm.Context.html#openmm.openmm.Context.getState) before you can access it in the State returned.  For instance, trying to call [State.getVelocities()](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/api-python/generated/openmm.openmm.State.html#openmm.openmm.State.getVelocities) on the object we have just created will raise an exception.\n",

    "The describeNextReport() method should take a Simulation object, and return a dictionary with a few fields informing OpenMM about the next report that the reporter wants to make.  The `steps` key should specify the number of steps remaining before the next report should be made.  The `include` key gives a list of the data items that should be included in a State that will be created for our reporter by OpenMM.  Here, `periodic=False` tells OpenMM not to apply periodic boundary conditions to the position coordinates (we will not discuss this at length here, but the [user guide](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/theory/05_other_features.html#periodic-boundary-conditions) and [Frequently Asked Questions](https://github.com/openmm/openmm/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#periodic) have more information about how periodic boundary conditions work in OpenMM).  A complete description of what describeNextReport() can return to OpenMM is given in the [user guide](https://docs.openmm.org/latest/userguide/application/04_advanced_sim_examples.html#extracting-and-reporting-forces-and-other-data).  OpenMM will process this information and automatically call the reporter's report() method when appropriate, with the Simulation object, as well as a State constructed according to our specifications.\n",

    "After following this tutorial, you should be able to:\n",

    "* Set up an OpenMM simulation using Amber input files\n",
    "* Retrieve and access the state of an OpenMM simulation as it runs\n",
    "* Use OpenMM's builtin reporter classes to output simulation results, and write your own custom reporters\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to load input files from a molecular dynamics program other than Amber.  For CHARMM, you will need a PSF file with structure information, a CRD file with coordinates, and then force field files in CHARMM's RTF (residue topology), PRM (parameters), and/or STR (stream file) formats.  These files can be loaded into OpenMM like\n",
    "```python\n",
    "psf = CharmmPsfFile('input.psf')\n",
    "crd = CharmmCrdFile('input.crd')\n",
    "params = CharmmParameterSet('input.prm', 'input.rtf', 'input.str', ...) # Include as many files as needed\n",

    "A Topology, positions, and a System can then be created like\n",
    "```python\n",
    "topology = psf.topology\n",
    "positions = crd.positions\n",
    "system = psf.createSystem(params, ...) # Include options here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For GROMACS, you will need a GRO file with coordinates, a TOP file with topology information, and a path to a directory with include files.  These can be loaded as\n",
    "```python\n",
    "gro = GromacsGroFile('input.gro')\n",

    "    periodicBoxVectors=gro.getPeriodicBoxVectors())\n",

    "positions = gro.positions\n",
    "system = top.createSystem(...) # Include options here\n",
    "```\n",
